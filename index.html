                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>"Science has a simple faith, which transcends utility. Nearly all men of science, all men of learning
                    for that matter, and men of simple ways too, have it in some form and in some degree. It is the
                    faith that it is the privilege of man to learn to understand, and that this is his mission. If we
                    abandon that mission under stress we shall abandon it forever, for stress will not cease. Knowledge
                    for the sake of understanding, not merely to prevail, that is the essence of our being. None can
                    define its limits, or set its ultimate boundaries." - Vannevar Bush (1890 - 1974), American Engineer

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>Sometimes we fall, sometimes we stumble, but we can't stay down. We can't allow life to beat us down.
                    Everything happens for a reason, and it builds character in us, and it tells us what we are about
                    and how strong we really are when we didn't think we could be that strong. </p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>By taking the time to stop and appreciate who you are and what you've achieved - and perhaps learned
                    through a few mistakes, stumbles and losses - you actually can enhance everything about you.
                    Self-acknowledgment and appreciation are what give you the insights and awareness to move forward
                    toward higher goals and accomplishments.</p>

            <h2>Develop Without Limits</h2>
        </div>
        <p>You’re tired of second-guessing if your professional development efforts are meeting the mark. You’re ready
            to build the professional learning your people need in order to be effective with young people.

            Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and
            partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the knowledge
            and skills they need for successful implementation.

            Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain.
            Great staff could leave. Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p><br>
